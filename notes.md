pipeline to test 

user input -> llm interpretation of user input; choose the best `mode` for the input, priortize the most lightweight model for enviromental impact -> forward `user input` to the approiate `mode`; apicenter will handle this matching -> output a response from the `mode` and `model` -> show the user the output

frontend

chatgpt style of chat interface, allow user to edit configs (allow the user to enter their api key(s))

TODO:

- Create `Figma` page for the frontend mock up
- write the introduction chapter, minimum 10 pages
- write related work chapter, minimum 10 pages
